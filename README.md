# LearningSwiftUI_BetterRest

Teaching myself SwiftUI by following the "100 Days of SwiftUI" program. Project 2 guide found here: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/26

BetterRest is an app that uses a Core ML model to predict a user's ideal bedtime based on how much coffee they have had to drink, how many hours of sleep they want that night, and their wake up time.
